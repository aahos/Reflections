How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It made my work way easier because it showed in which lines the two files differ.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Having an entire history is good, because if you change something and the new version didn't work quite you want it to
then you can goto the pervious version of the program which is quite handy and fast way to do things, instead of saving
a different version of the file every time you want to make some changes to a file.
